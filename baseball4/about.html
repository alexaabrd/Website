	<h3>A Case for Camps</h3>
	Camps are an excellent setting for instruction and learning the basics and intricacies of the game. 
	The competition is slowed down and the learning and improvement is geared up. 
	Of course, the reason you go out for baseball is for the competition and games because that's where the fun is, 
	but many times the instruction takes a back seat during the hectic schedule of the season. 
	Camps slow the pace down where instead of preparing for the big game, skill improvement is emphasized. 
	So, our goal is for every camper to leave the camp improved, 
	with an increased appreciation for the game of baseball, and to enjoy stepping on the diamond.
      </div>

      <div id="philosophy" class="about-content section">
	<h3>Camp Philosophy</h3>
	Twenty years ago, longtime Ft.Bend area Coach Ted "Crowhop" Harris wanted to bring a 
	premier baseball camp to the Ft. Bend area dedicated to teaching the game in a competitive, enjoyable atmosphere.
	CCBC now enjoys the reputation that nowhere in the Houston area can you receive better baseball camp instruction.
	Talk to previous campers and you will learn how their game improved 
	and that they continue to use the coaching points and phrases learned in CCBC. 
	Our desire is to teach an appreciation of the game 
	and instill a desire to improve and work on their skills even "on a rainy day by themselves."
	<br><br>
	Why pay more and travel further when the best is right here in Ft. Bend?
	<br><br>
	The philosophy is simple: 
	<ol>
	 <li>Teach good, sound baseball emphasizing individual and team skills</li>
	 <li>Keep the player-coach teaching ratios low and manageable</li>
	 <li>Have fun doing it (most important)</li>
	<ol>

	<h3>Details About Coach Crowhop's Baseball Camps</h3>
	The first day of summer camp will be an evaluation day to divide players by age & skill level as much as possible.
	Competitive drills, video evaluation, and awards will supplement the instruction underlying 
	the philosophy of "make it fun." 
	The remaining time will be spent on "World Series" games. 
	Coach Crowhop's Baseball Camps is designed to offer fundamental instruction to younger players, 
	while offering advanced training to older more advanced players covering the physical 
	and mental aspects of hitting, pitching, and catching as well as pitch selection and strength development. 
	Pitchers' arms will not be hampered for League play. 
	Campers will recieve a T-shirt, certificate,  and written evaluation.
