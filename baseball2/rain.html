        <h3>In case of rain:</h3>
        An update will be provided at 7:00AM here.
        <br>Updates will be given every 30 minutes after to inform you of the modifications, if any.    
        If fields are wet, drills may be on the asphalt so we ask campers to bring an additional
        pair of soft soled shoes.
        We have made modifications through these type of weather patterns many times in our 21 years and we assure you,
        the kids will have a ball and learn lots of baseball.
        If it rains "on top of us" we will be under cover.
        We will wait a reasonable time and then resume camp.
        If a storm continues and camp is called for the day,
        we may start earlier and finish later the next day to make up for lost time.
        Also, Friday is our rain make-up day in case of continuing rain and we have to call a day of camp.
        We will stay with each camper till they are picked up.
